   <h1>Brockhampton is awesome</h1>
   <a>You should listen to their music, especially their new albums TM and The Family. They're really good my favorite from TM is " Man on the moon " and my favorite from The Family is " Gold Teeth " The album resembles kanye's early work and the beat reminds me of yeezus.</a>

   <i class="quote">Nowadays all I wanna do is party
    Getting fucked up in my hotel's lobby
    Only made this to get out the deal, partly
    So don't ask me if the crew is still talking
    Do we see each other? Hardly
    Shit we made together? Godly
    Did we sign for too many motherfucking albums? Prolly.</i>
